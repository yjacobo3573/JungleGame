      As part of my Jungle game, I implemented all the basic components neccessary for my game to be fully functional. As part of my controller component, I specifically made the left and right error keys move the player back or forward. 
      Moreover, I added two additonal components which were super speed and a jump component. For super speed I simply increased the players speed going forward and I designated the key 's' to be used. 
      For my jump component I simple increased the player's velocity in the y direction using the up arrow key. As of right now, this component isn't finished since I still need to implement gravity logic in order to bring the player down in a realistic way.  

      Below is a video showing full functionality
